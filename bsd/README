This directory includes example code of how to use the uIP TCP/IP
stack. The code is used for testing uIP as a user process under
FreeBSD.

Follow these steps to test uIP under FreeBSD:

1) Compile the code using GNU make (gmake):

   > gmake

2) su to root:

   > su
   (type password for the root account)

3) run the "uip" binary:

   # ./uip

4) uIP is now up and running with IP address 192.168.0.2. You can now
   test uIP by firing up another window and issue the following
   commands:

   > ping 192.168.0.2

   > telnet 192.168.0.2 http

   It it also possible to connect to the small web server using
   Netscape and the URL <http://192.168.0.2/>. Be sure to turn off any
   proxies first.

Please see the files "uipopt.h" and "main.c" for more information.
